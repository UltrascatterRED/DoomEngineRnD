This file is a "catch-all" for anything important I want to write down
from my research. Different topics of info will generally be separate 
paragraphs/chunks of info.

[NOTES TO SELF]
* Take time to digest and document the precise mathematical theory used
  to draw 3D graphics to the screen (esp. from the Doom in C tutorial).

[RESEARCH NOTES]
* typedef - [define it]
* What are the typedefs in the tutorial for?
  > time
  > keys
  > math
  > player

* What do the methods of the tutorial program do and HOW?

* In main(), WHAT do each of the glut functions do? (do not worry
  about the HOW, abstraction with libraries is fine)
